MARCELLUS	|
	|  officers.
MARCELLUS	And liegemen to the Dane.
MARCELLUS	O, farewell, honest soldier:
	Who hath relieved you?
MARCELLUS	Holla! Bernardo!
MARCELLUS	What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
MARCELLUS	Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
	And will not let belief take hold of him
	Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
	Therefore I have entreated him along
	With us to watch the minutes of this night;
	That if again this apparition come,
	He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
MARCELLUS	Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!
MARCELLUS	Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
MARCELLUS	Question it, Horatio.
MARCELLUS	It is offended.
MARCELLUS	'Tis gone, and will not answer.
MARCELLUS	                  Is it not like the king?
MARCELLUS	Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
	With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
MARCELLUS	Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
	Why this same strict and most observant watch
	So nightly toils the subject of the land,
	And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
	And foreign mart for implements of war;
	Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
	Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
	What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
	Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
	Who is't that can inform me?
MARCELLUS	Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
MARCELLUS	'Tis gone!
MARCELLUS	It faded on the crowing of the cock.
	Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
	Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
	The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
	And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
	The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
	No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
	So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
MARCELLUS	Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
	Where we shall find him most conveniently.
MARCELLUS	My good lord--
MARCELLUS	My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
MARCELLUS	|
	|	We do, my lord.
MARCELLUS	|
	|  Arm'd, my lord.
MARCELLUS	|
	|             My lord, from head to foot.
MARCELLUS	|
	| Longer, longer.
MARCELLUS	                  Look, with what courteous action
	It waves you to a more removed ground:
	But do not go with it.
MARCELLUS	You shall not go, my lord.
MARCELLUS	Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.
MARCELLUS	Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
MARCELLUS	Nay, let's follow him.
MARCELLUS	|
	| [Within]  My lord, my lord,--
MARCELLUS	[Within]	Lord Hamlet,--
MARCELLUS	How is't, my noble lord?
MARCELLUS	Nor I, my lord.
MARCELLUS	|
MARCELLUS	|
MARCELLUS	                  Nor I, my lord, in faith.
MARCELLUS	                  We have sworn, my lord, already.
